# Secret Santa

A minimalist web application to organize a Secret Santa event.

## Create an Event

Creating an event is very simple. You will need to enter a name for your event and add a list of at least three people, using their names and their email addresses. After the event is created, an email will be sent to every person in the list. The email will include the name of the event, the event key, and a unique personal key.

:mega: Don't forget to include yourself in the list!

## Reveal 

Use the event key and your personal key that were provided in the email to reveal to whom you will be giving a gift.
